# The Haslemere Human Mobility and Proximity Dataset

## Summary

This dataset captures high-resolution human mobility and interpersonal proximity patterns collected from 469 volunteers in the town of Haslemere, UK, over three consecutive days (12–14 October 2017). The data were collected via a custom mobile phone application and processed to produce time-resolved pairwise distance measurements between individuals. The dataset was developed in the context of the BBC Four documentary *Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic*, and it supports research in infectious disease modeling and human behaviour.

## Contents
### Data
- `data/HaslemereProximity.csv`: Main dataset containing pairwise distances within 50 metres between individuals at 5-minute intervals.
- `data/TimeConversion.csv`: Mapping of dataset time indices to real-world timestamps (British Summer Time).

### Code
- `code/visualise_daily_networks.R`: Code for importing the Haslemere dataset and visualising pairwise interactions (<10m) aggregated by day, in R.
- `code/visualise_daily_networks.py`: Code for importing the Haslemere dataset and visualising pairwise interactions (<10m) aggregated by day, in python.

### Figures

- Participants represent a convenience sample (~4.2% of the town population).

### Temporal Scope
- Start: 2017-10-12 07:00 BST  
- End: 2017-10-14 22:55 BST  
- Interval: 5 minutes

## Methods Summary

- Data collected using the BBC Pandemic mobile app.
- GPS-derived locations aggregated into 5-minute bins.
- Missing data imputed using the last known location or inferred home location.
- Night-time data (23:00–07:00) excluded for privacy.
- Pairwise distances computed for all user pairs within 50 meters at each time step.
- Data further used in a simulated SEI model to explore disease transmission dynamics.

For full methodology, see the associated publication.

## Usage Notes

- Not a complete census of Haslemere residents; represents a sample of adult contacts.
- Physical barriers (e.g., walls) are not accounted for in distance measurements.
- Night-time movement is not included.
- Suitable for studies in dynamic networks, mobility, epidemic simulation, and contact structure.
- When reusing the data, please cite the associated Data Descriptor and acknowledge the BBC Pandemic project.
